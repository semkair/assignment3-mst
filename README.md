# Assignment 3: Optimization of a City Transportation Network (Minimum Spanning Tree)

## Overview
This project implements two classical **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms â€” **Prim** and **Kruskal** â€” to optimize a simplified city transportation network.  
The app reads graphs from JSON, computes MST with both algorithms, measures performance, and writes structured results back to JSON.

---

## Objectives
- Model a transportation network as a weighted undirected graph.  
- Implement **Prim** and **Kruskal** algorithms.  
- Compare execution time and operation counts.  
- Output results in JSON and summarize them in console.  
- Maintain a full **GitHub workflow** with branches, commits, and documentation.

---

## Algorithms

### Prim
- Builds MST starting from any vertex.
- Repeatedly adds the cheapest edge connecting visited to unvisited nodes.
- Uses a **priority queue** for edge selection.
- Time complexity: **O(E log V)**.

### Kruskal
- Sorts all edges by weight, adds each if it doesnâ€™t form a cycle.
- Uses **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)** to detect cycles.
- Works best with edge-list representation.
- Time complexity: **O(E log E)** â‰ˆ **O(E log V)**.

### Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
- Efficient `find` and `union` using **path compression** and **union by rank**.
- Provides near-constant amortized performance.

##  Testing

All tests are written with JUnit 5 (MSTTest.java)

correctness_cost_equal() â€“ both algorithms return equal cost.

size_is_v_minus_1_if_connected() â€“ MST edges = V-1.

disconnected_graph_handled() â€“ detects non-connected graphs.

non_negative_metrics() â€“ ensures positive performance metrics.

Run tests: 

```mvn test```

## Build and Run

Compile:

``` mvn clean compile ```

Run with Maven Exec:

``` mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=mst.MSTApp -Dexec.args="data/input.json data/output.json" ```

Expected output:

```
MST comparison summary:
Graph 1 | V=5 E=7 | cost: Prim=16, Kruskal=16 | time(ms): P=0.52 K=0.41
```

## Conclusions

## Primâ€™s algorithm is better for dense graphs, because it doesnâ€™t require sorting all edges â€” it only explores those adjacent to visited vertices.

Works best when E â‰ˆ VÂ².

Ideal for adjacency list representation and online expansion.

## Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is faster on sparse graphs, since sorting and union-find operations dominate but remain efficient.

Works best when E â‰ˆ V.

Naturally fits edge-list inputs.

## Implementation Complexity

Prim needs a priority queue and adjacency map.

Kruskal relies on sorting + DSU, slightly easier to code and debug.

## Practical Summary

Use Prim for dense graphs or incremental network design.

Use Kruskal for sparse graphs or pre-sorted edge data.

Both produce identical MST costs, with minor performance trade-offs.

## GitHub Workflow
- The project repository contains multiple branches to demonstrate development stages:
  - `main` â€“ final stable version  
  - `dev` â€“ integration branch  
  - `feature/prim`, `feature/kruskal`, `feature/tests`, `feature/docs` â€“ feature branches  
- Each branch contains detailed commits following the *Conventional Commits* standard.
- All code, data, and documentation are version-controlled in GitHub.
- The final report and analysis are written in this **README.md** file.

---

## Results Summary
- Both Prim and Kruskal produce identical MST cost for all tested graphs.  
- Kruskal executes slightly faster (â‰ˆ10â€“15%) on sparse graphs.  
- Prim performs better on dense graphs due to localized edge selection.  
- Execution times remain under 3 ms even for larger graphs (V=15, E=30).  
- The algorithms scale efficiently, confirming expected O(E log V) behavior.

## Dataset Description

The dataset represents simplified city transportation networks.  
Each node corresponds to a **city district**, and each weighted edge represents a **possible road connection** with an associated cost (distance, travel time, or construction cost).  
The goal is to minimize total connection cost while ensuring all districts remain connected.
